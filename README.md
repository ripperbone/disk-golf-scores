# Disk Golf Scores
Disk golf scorekeeping made simple for Android

## About
Thanks for trying out Disk Golf Scores. The goal of this project is to be able to keep track of scores/statistics on the fly while playing disk golf and then be able to export them back to the computer to review later.


## Notes
The only device I have tested this on is a Nexus 7. Hopefully differently sized screens will look ok but it might require some tweaking.
